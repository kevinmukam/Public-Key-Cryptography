# RSA Public-Key-Cryptography

Python program to generate and use a public/private key pair to encrypt and decrypt messages. It consists of 2 functions and a main testing part.


The Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a set of policies that administer certificates and public-private key pairs. Public-key cryptography is asymmetric, involving the use of two separate keys, in contrast to symmetric encryption, which uses only one key. The most distinct feature of PKI is that it uses a pair of keys to achieve the underlying security service. The key pair comprises of private key and public key.

RSA is the most widely used public key algorithm.
